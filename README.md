The repo includes the resources for an introduction SQL workshop, focused on learning the basic SQL concepts and then applying them in a business environment in the workshop
The audience I had in mind was people who knew nothing about SQL, and ideally, they should be able to understand some basic concepts around SQL and data analysis after the workshop.

The event was hosted by [IEEE University of Patras](https://github.com/IEEE-SB-Univ-of-Patras) and held in Greek.

### The speakers:
- [Ilias Xenogiannis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilias-xenogiannis/)
